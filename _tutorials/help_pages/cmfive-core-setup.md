## Set up The cmfive-core For Development

To start you will need to clone the cmfive-boilerplate. Go to the 2pi Software account on GitHub, and navigate to the cmfive-boilerplate. Above the repository file on the left, click the green button labelled 'Code'. Copy the link in the popup.

Now open your Git application, and choose to clone a repositosry from GitHub. Make sure it will save on your device in the folder that your localhost points to. Use the copied URL in the relevant box and hit clone.

When you clone the boilerplate, it will set up a version of the cmfive-core for you. The next step is to set this up seperately in your Git application.
